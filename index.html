  <p>"Accessibility Forgiveness" is a design principle that emphasizes creating digital products or interfaces that are
    forgiving user errors and accommodating diverse user needs. In the context of software design, it involves 
    anticipating and mitigating potential user mistakes, ensuring that users with varying abilities can interact with the 
    application comfortably. This design principle is crucial for fostering inclusivity and providing a positive experience
    for all users. Form design on websites or applications is a prominent example of accessibility forgiveness.
    Clear, concise error messages that also offer guidance on how to fix errors help create a welcoming and understanding environment. 
    An accessible design would, for example, show a straightforward error message next to the incorrect field in a form if a user 
    forgets to fill it out, directing them to what needs to be corrected. This method avoids frustration and makes it possible for 
    users — including those with disabilities — to utilize the form effectively. </p>
